# Bank Database System
Bank Database and Software Interface
This project is a Bank Management System that I designed and implemented as part of my learning journey in database design and software development.

# Technologies used
SQL Server – for designing and implementing the database.

Entity-Relationship (ER) Model – created to visualize and structure the database before implementation.

Python – for developing the user interface.

# Key features
User-friendly interface to interact with the bank database.

Secure and structured storage of customer and account information.

Ability to handle credit operations and transactions.

Modular structure for potential future improvements.

# What you’ll find in this repository
[ER Diagram] – diagram of the database structure.

[Documentation]– additional details and explanation (if available).

[BankDB script] – SQL scripts to create and populate the database.

[Data analysis (query) [BankDB join query] [View and Index] ] - Analytics queries

[Bank Management System] – source code for the user interface.



# Notes
I created this project to practice database design, apply what I've learned about stored procedures, views, and joins, and gain hands-on experience building a working system from scratch. It helped me connect theoretical knowledge with real-world application.
This is a learning project and still open for feedback and improvement. I'm always looking to make it more robust and complete.
